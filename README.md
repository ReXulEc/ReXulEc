<h1 align="center">👋 Hey, I'm Mert! </h1>
  
<p>
  
 🎉 Hey there, I'm Mert, a junior front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful and interactive web experiences. I love working with modern web technologies like React, Next, Svelte, and Vue, as well as using Node.js for server-side development. I'm a self-taught learner who is always looking to improve my skills and keep up with the latest industry trends. When it comes to projects, I can work solo or as part of a team, and I like to keep things fun and collaborative. If you'd like to learn more about my experience and skills, you can check out my resume or my website.
